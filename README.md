# shop_design
This is the frontend part of the shop project.

Requirements: 

- Android Studio newest version installed
- Flutter newest version installed
- Downloaded an emulator on Android Studio
- IDE of your choice (I used VSCode, Android Studio recommended by Flutter docs for Windows)

To test the app you have to run the main.dart file on your emulator.
